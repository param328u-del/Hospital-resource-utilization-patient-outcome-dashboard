# Hospital-resource-utilization-patient-outcome-dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the HCL–GUVI Hackathon.  
The objective of this project is to analyze hospital data and provide meaningful insights using a Power BI dashboard.

## Problem Statement
Hospitals handle large amounts of patient and billing data, making it difficult to track admissions, length of stay, and department-wise performance effectively.

## Solution
This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps visualize:
- Patient admissions
- Length of hospital stay
- Department-wise patient distribution
- Billing and revenue insights

The dashboard supports better decision-making for hospital management.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub
- Google Drive (Deployment& Demo dashboard vedio)

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Patient details
- Admission and discharge dates
- Department information
- Billing amount

All data is stored in Excel sheets and imported into Power BI for analysis.

## Key Dashboard Features
- Total number of admissions
- Average length of stay
- Department-wise patient count
- Billing analysis and trends
- Interactive filters and visuals

## How to View the Project
1. Download the Power BI (.pbix) file from this repository.
2. Open it using Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the interactive dashboard using filters and charts.

## Deployment Note
The solution is submitted as a Power BI (.pbix) file.
Please download the file and open it using Power BI Desktop, as online preview is not supported for PBIX files.

## Project Outcome
The dashboard provides clear insights into hospital operations and helps improve efficiency, planning, and resource utilization.
